MySQL FOREIGN KEY Constraint
The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.
A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.
The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.

FOREIGN KEY on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL creates a FOREIGN KEY on the "PersonID" column when the "Orders" table is created:

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    PersonID int,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);
