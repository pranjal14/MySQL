The MySQL WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

WHERE Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Note: The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.!

Text Fields vs. Numeric Fields
SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes).
However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes:
Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID = 1;

Operators in The WHERE Clause
The following operators can be used in the WHERE clause:
Operator	Description	Example
=	Equal	
>	Greater than	
<	Less than	
>=	Greater than or equal	
<=	Less than or equal	
<>	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=	
BETWEEN	Between a certain range	
LIKE	Search for a pattern	
IN	To specify multiple possible values for a column
