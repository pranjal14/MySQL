MySQL Joining Tables
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Example
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;

Supported Types of Joins in MySQL
INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
CROSS JOIN: Returns all records from both tables
