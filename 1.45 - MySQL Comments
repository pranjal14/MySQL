MySQL Comments
Comments are used to explain sections of SQL statements, or to prevent execution of SQL statements.

Single Line Comments
Single line comments start with --.

Any text between -- and the end of the line will be ignored (will not be executed).
The following example uses a single-line comment as an explanation:
Example
-- Select all:
SELECT * FROM Customers;

Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored.
The following example uses a multi-line comment as an explanation:
Example
/*Select all the columns
of all the records
in the Customers table:*/
SELECT * FROM Customers;
