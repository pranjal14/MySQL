MySQL Comments
Comments are used to explain sections of SQL statements, or to prevent execution of SQL statements.

Single Line Comments
Single line comments start with --.

Any text between -- and the end of the line will be ignored (will not be executed).
The following example uses a single-line comment as an explanation:
Example
-- Select all:
SELECT * FROM Customers;
