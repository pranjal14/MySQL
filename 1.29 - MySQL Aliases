MySQL Aliases
Aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.
Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.
An alias only exists for the duration of that query.
An alias is created with the AS keyword.

Alias Column Syntax
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
