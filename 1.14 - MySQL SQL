What is SQL?
SQL is the standard language for dealing with Relational Databases.
SQL is used to insert, search, update, and delete database records.

How to Use SQL
The following SQL statement selects all the records in the "Customers" table:
Example
SELECT * FROM Customers;

Keep in Mind That...
SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT

Semicolon after SQL Statements?
Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.
Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.
